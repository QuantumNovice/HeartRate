Why The Heck do I Need this? Realtime heart rate monitoring Arduino, ESP, Wemos Projects Fixed Heart Beat Sensor I have a dedicated server for IoT for CPU/GPU intensive tasks (The house of FUTURE!!) How Does it Work? Step 1: Assumptions: Finger on the camera. Flashlight is on. Step 2: Calculate Image brightness over time. Step 3: Calculate derivatives and find wavelength, that is time between R-R Peak. Step 4: Drop values with similar standard deviation (Trust me you don't want heart beat of 600 bpm :D ) Examples Reading Local Files from heartbeat import HeartBeat beat = HeartBeat(\"3gp/mp4/whatever\") beat.get_brightness_from_video() beat = beat.analyze_heart_beat() print(beat) Reading Video Streams from heartbeat import CamBeat beat = CamBeat(\"3gp/mp4/whatever\") beat.get_brightness_from_video() beat = beat.analyze_heart_beat() print(beat) How it sees your heart beat.
